                The essence of instrumental music lays in the fact that one is able to express in tones that what one is unable to say in words. Instruments bring out your inner thoughts or your own visuals to the sound without
                  the need of lyrics dictating what you feel.
                  <br>
                  So we welcome you all to "Nirvana" the solo instrumental music competition.Brush up your skills and get ready to rock and roll.
